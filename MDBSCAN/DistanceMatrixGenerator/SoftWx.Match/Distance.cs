    /// <summary>The Distance class provides threadsafe static methods that compute the
    /// distance between two strings.</summary>
    /// <remarks>The methods are static versions of methods from classes that implement
    /// the IDistance interface. In general (although not neccessarily) these static
    /// methods will be about the same speed or slightly faster than the methods of
    /// IDistance instantiated classes, but these static methods will usually be less
    /// memory efficient. Note that since the methods in this class are not implementations
    /// of the IDistance interface, some argument types and return types may differ from
    /// the interface. The types will be those that match most closely to the nature of
    /// the algorithm. For example, the Levenshtein methods take an int maxDistance and
    /// return an int value instead of double since it only deals with integral values.
    /// The methods in this class also can be used as string extension methods as in this
    /// example:
    ///   <code>var distance = "hello".Levenshtein("goodbye");</code>
